ftl-tools
=========

This is a collection of Python scripts for dealing with Faster Than Light profiles. The motivation was playing on multiple computers and wanting to keep the achievements synchronized. This is used in the back-end of the [FTL Profile Merge](http://www.jmaygarden.com/ftl.html) website.
